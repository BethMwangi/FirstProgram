    <h2 style="one"> The Considerate Hunter </h2>
            <p> Once upon a time there lived a hunter called Ajakasi. Many hunters lived in his village. Some hunters used guns, some used bows and arrows, others used sticks and cutlasses to do their hunting.

Ajakasi went on a hunting expedition early one morning. He went deep into the bush. He wondered around all day long, but the bush seemed deserted, and by late afternoon he had not even seen a bird. He was terribly tired and hungry. He decided to go back home. Just as he was about to turn back, he heard an unusual sound coming from somewhere in the distance. He listened carefully, thinking he finally got lucky; he hard peeap peeap peeap uuwuurgh oowuurgh uuuwuurgh.

</p> 
    <p>He said to himself, goodness, that sounds like a big animal, maybe even a lion, I’ll sneak up carefully and see if I can find it. He headed in the direction from which the sound was coming, and soon he came upon a clearing in the forest, and right there in the middle of the clearing was a big hole. He approached gingerly, and craned his neck so as to be able to see inside the pit, and what did he see?

He saw a lion.

</p>
            <p> Instinctively he jumped back, then after collecting his nerves, he approached the hole again, and craned his neck so as to be able to see inside the pit; then he saw a snake in the same pit! And he saw a man, crouching in one of the corners. Ajakasi couldn’t help but wonder what was happening down there, why was the lion not eating the man?

Then he also saw a rat! He couldn’t believe is eyes, so there was a lion down there, and a huge snake, and a man and a rat!

The lion was he first to spot Ajakasi. Please Mr Hunter, get me out of this pit! I‘m terribly hungry! Ajakasi shook his head, and with a trembling voice, said: I’m really sorry Mr Lion, but I can’t do that! A hungry lion? How can I pull you out? As soon as I get you up here you’re going to have me for your lunch!</p>
                <p> The lion growled in response. Don’t you think I could have eaten this man here, he asked. Or the snake, or the rat? We all agreed not to eat each other but to stick together, so that we might all get out of here. I guarantee that if you help us you will be safe

The man in the pit joined in: Please Mr Hunter, believe us, the lion is telling the truth, please get us out of here, please help us. The snake joined in, hissing, and the rat was squeaking. The hunter was touched.

</p>
                <p>All right, he said, all right, I’ll help you. Just hold on while I find something. He went into the trees, and found the longest possible rope, he tied one end to the nearest tall tree, and pulled it hard to test it. When he was satisfied that it would be strong enough to pull all those creatures out of the pit. He threw the loose end into the hole. And who was the first to come out? Of course, the lion, the snake came out next, and then the rat and finally the man crawled to the surface. The lion gave Ajakasi a heavy handshake. Ouch, screamed Ajakasi, you’ve hurt me! That was painful! Is that how you’re going to thank me?

No, no, no, no, said the lion, Thank you very much indeed, Mr Hunter, I will see you again. With that the lion disappeared into the jungle. The snake thanked him too, and slithered away. The man thanked him, and ran off. 
                
                </p>
            
               <p> The rat was the last to thank him; I won’t forget your kindness, he said before scurrying off in the undergrowth.

Ajakasi was left all by himself; it was getting dark and he remembered how hungry he was, so he too set off back to his hut in the village.

Several days later, very early in the morning, even before the sun had crawled over the horizon, he heard somebody knocking loudly on his door.</p>
                <p> Bhoumm Bhoumm Bhoumm! Who is there, asked Ajakasi. But there was no reply. He opened the door, and there stood the lion. Ajakasi was scared to the marrow, and almost threw the door shut again, but the lion raised a paw in greeting. Mr Lion, sighed Ajakasi, you really scared me there! I’m sorry about that, said the lion, I suppose that can’t be helped. I can’t very well turn up here in broad daylight, can I now? Ajakasi had to agree. Well then, said the lion, you did something wonderful for me the other day, you were very brave to help the four of us get out of that pit. So I have come to thank you, just come over here. The lion stood back and Ajakasi stepped outside. There, in front of his house he found a huge pile of wild meat. All for you, said the lion, and wandered off.

Ajakasi was very excited. He sat to work immediately cleaning the meat and cutting it up. He kept some in his hut and took the rest to the city to sell. He got a lot of money for it! A few more days went by, when Ajakasi was woken again by the same noise coming from his door. He opened the door carefully, and found the lion there again. The lion directed him to the usual spot, and there was an even bigger pile of meat! Again, Ajakasi cleaned the meat, cut it up and took it to the market to sell. He got even more money. The remarkable thing was that the lion kept coming back every three or four days to bring more meat. Ajakasi became a very rich man. He could pay his children’s school fees, he built a new house, he bought new clothes for himself and all his family members He was turning into a very happy man.

Then one day, he noticed a hole in the roof of his new house. Oooh, what is this? He went to inspect and to his surprise he saw a rat peeping through the hole. Aaaii, said Ajakasi, who are you, and what are you doing to my roof, making holes in it? The rat said: Don’t you remember me? I’m the rat you rescued from the pit in the jungle, some time ago now. If it hadn’t been for you coming along I would surely have ended up as supper for the lion or the snake! I’ve come to bring you something to thank you, just wait there a minute.</p>
